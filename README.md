# Data Structure and Algorithm Practice
 Personal practice using Python

Since I'm taking electrical engineering, I'm missing out on data structures and algorithms content. So, in the process of trying to rapidly teach myself the basics, I'm making my own implementations of key data structures. I'll be throwing in some sorting algorithms along the way. 

Maybe my comment-filled code with some notes about time complexity can help someone else trying to learn this stuff. This is all strictly for educational purposes - I'm not making any endorsements about functionality.

Why Python? I want to focus on the content at hand, not language-related quirks. Sorry, no pointers here.
